        As an ongoing React professional, I have already completed several
        projects using this technology, including the use of third-party
        libraries such as Styled Components and Firebase. I am committed to
        continuously improving my knowledge and skills in React to contribute to
        large-scale projects. My goal is to advance to a senior developer role,
        where I can lead and direct teams to build innovative and impactful
        applications.
